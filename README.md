# 🧩 Eight Puzzle Solver with BFS & A* Search Algorithms

This project implements solutions for the classic **Eight Puzzle** problem using two fundamental search algorithms: **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **A* Search (A\*)**. It provides a clear comparison of their performance and visualizes the solving process step-by-step.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Eight Puzzle consists of a 3x3 grid with tiles numbered 1 through 8 and one empty space. The goal is to move tiles until the puzzle reaches the target configuration.

This project aims to:

- Implement BFS and A* algorithms to find the shortest path to the solution  
- Visualize each step of the search with nodes representing puzzle states  
- Compare the efficiency and speed of BFS and A* in solving the puzzle

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Explores states level by level guaranteeing shortest path  
- 🌟 **A* Search (A\*):** Uses heuristics (Manhattan distance) for faster, more efficient search  
- 🎨 **Visualization:** Stepwise display of puzzle states and search nodes during execution  
- 📊 **Performance Metrics:** Compare time taken, number of nodes explored, and path length
